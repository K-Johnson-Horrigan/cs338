1.  1    192.168.58.128  132.163.96.1    TCP    [SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=3935413267 TSecr=0 WS=128
    2    132.163.96.1    192.168.58.128  TCP    [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460

2.  60366; port number is required to specify not just the machine that the client is located at, but the particular software.

3.  4    132.163.96.1    192.168.58.128    DAYTIME    DAYTIME Response

4.  It includes the date and time, but also:
    - the Modified Julian Date (MJD): 59673
    - daylight savings: 50 (thus currently on daylight savings time)
    - whether a leap second is imminent: 0 (no)
    - an estimate of the health of the time server: 0 (fully healthy)
    - time advance (in milliseconds): 521.7
    - the time standard/location: UTC(NIST)

5.  [SYN] represents a "synchronization packet" that communicates port and sequence number.

6.  [ACK] represents an acknowledgement of a received packet, indicating which packet it received (by that packet's sequence number). This is required to permit TCP's recovery from error to happen.

7.  [FIN] represents the "finish up" packet that indicates the sender (can be either the client or the server) is done talking.

8.  The nc client; I can tell because the [FIN] (finish up) package was sent from source 192.168.58.128, which was the source address for the first [SYN] package, and the nc client initiated the interaction. To summarize the logic: the nc client was the source for the first [SYN] package - the source for the first [SYN] package was the source for the [FIN] package - the nc client initiated the closing of the TCP connection.

===== HTTP =====
1.  2 TCP connections were opened. 
2.  Yes! It seems like a GET request was sent (192.etc is the client IP address):
     7    192.168.58.128    45.79.89.123    HTTP    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
3.  Also yes! It seems another GET request was sent for the image.
    11    192.168.58.128    45.79.89.123    HTTP    GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1

===== QUESTIONS =====
For some of the TCP packages I see [PSH] or [TCP Keep-Alive]; what do they do?
