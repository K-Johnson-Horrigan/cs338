QUESTIONS: 
1. 172.23.96.84
2. host <hostname>
	eg, if I wanted a list of IP adresses associated with google.com, I could execute:
	host google.com
3. host <IP address>
	similarly, if I want the host name for an IP address, I can use host again, eg (for blue.mathcs.carleton.edu):
	host 137.22.5.8 
4. scp <localfile> <destination>:<filepath at destination>
	eg, if I wanted to copy a text file from my local machine to my account on the edmonstone research server, 
	I would execute the following command: 
	scp test.txt johnsonk4@edmonstone.mathcs.carleton.edu:/Accounts/johnsonk4
5. nmap <host> -p<port #>
	eg., if I want to check whether there's a process listening on port 80 for host google.com, I could execute:
	nmap google.com -p80
6. nmap <host> --open
7. curl <name of webpage> --output <name of file you want to save it to>
8. curl <name of webpage> --head
9. curl <name of webpage> --head --verbose 
	this option will also display the response headers, but supressing that/removing it 
	seems to not be a built-in option, and instead requires some fancy cli work
	that I'm not sure I would be permitted to use: https://www.baeldung.com/linux/curl-request-headers
