===== ANALYSIS =====
STRIDE threat analysis
  + stealing someone else's tapirsunlimited account (to ruin their good name, steal their super-secrete tapir pics, etc). Can be done if login
  information is insecure; either on the user end (their username & password are written on a sticky not stuck to their monitor) or on the database
  server end (if attackers gain access to database server(s) and passwords are somehow insufficiently secured)
    - STRIDE categories: tampering (change their fanfiction and make it super bad)
                         elevation of privilege (can now do things they weren't allowed to)
                         information disclosure (can read private DMs about tapir roleplay)
                         repudiation (authenticity of the user behind the account is in question--if this account is then used to do bad things--eg
                         traffic tapirs--who is liable?)
    - mitigation: require a password of x length and y complexity
                  even better, require multi-factor authentication
                  notifying email on file about uncharacteristic behavior (eg, logging on from a different device/continent)
                  secure passwords on stored in the database server with cryptographic hashing (and "salts")

  + DOS attack (overwhelm the server with queries so that no-one else can access the site)
      - cat: DOS (surprise!)
      - mit: limit the amount of requests that can come from a certain location/IP address (seems like can be circumvented easily with VPN though?)

 + Break (physically, with a bat) the hardware/servers that are hosting the website
     - cat: DOS (users are no longer able to access the website)
            tampering (if the database server is destroyed, the information contained therein may also be deleted)
     - mit: Security guards (with livable wage so that they can't be bribed)
            back up data on multiple, geographically separate servers

 + Listen in on user connection to tapirsunlimited & modify packets sent (given by Jeff)
     - cat: information disclosure (read potentially un-published tapir posts)
            tampering (could modify those posts)
            elevation of privilege (gain ability to modify/observe other user's confidential data)
            spoofing (pretend to be authentic user to the web client)
     - mit: communicate using HTTPS

  + accessing database to modify it (eg through sql injection in credential or other data-submitting forms)
      - cat: tampering (changing the database?)
             information disclosure (potentially retrieve data? SELECT * FROM users ?)
             elevation of privilege (can modify the database and other user's data, which is not a permitted function)
             repudiation (unless every single query is logged, which would be costly, could override permissions & modify the database without
             necessarily those changes being noticed/traceable)
      - mit: do the method thing we learned about in Software Development (limiting characters, etc) to ensure that user-generated-text is not
      treated as actual query
