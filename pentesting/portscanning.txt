1. Passive information gathering
    What domain did you investigate?
      carleton.edu
    What is its IP address?
      35.227.227.189
    When does the domain's registration expire?
      31-Jul-2024
    What information, if any, did you learn about the people or corporation responsible for the
    domain in question? (Your answer could be less interesting than you had hoped due to the
    increasingly common use of domain privacy services. In that case, at least give me information
    about what you learned about the relevant domain privacy service.)

2. Host detection
    List the IP addresses for all the active hosts you found on the local network (i.e. the hosts
    whose IP addresses have the same first 24 bits--i.e. the same W.X.Y of the IP address W.X.Y.Z--
    as Kali's IP address).
      Nmap scan report for 192.168.58.1
      Nmap scan report for 192.168.58.2
      Nmap scan report for 192.168.58.128
      Nmap scan report for 192.168.58.129

    What entities do those IP addresses represent?
      192.168.58.1 (the router id?)
      192.168.58.2 (another host on the machine with host id 2?)
      192.168.58.128 (Kali!?)
      192.168.58.129 (seems to be the active Metasploitable machine)

    For each possible candidate IP address it was searching in the local network, what steps did
    nmap take? (You can answer this question by examining the Wireshark captured packets. If you
    want to make it easier to read the relevant packets, try doing "nmap -sn [just-one-ip-address]"
    instead of the /24 thing.)
      First, there's an ARP "who has" request for an IP address (192.168.58.1):
        3	VMware_7c:b6:52	VMware_e0:85:18	ARP   Who has 192.168.58.2? Tell 192.168.58.128
      Then we get an ARP response with a hex location for the queried ip address (if it's active)
        4	VMware_e0:85:18	VMware_7c:b6:52	ARP   192.168.58.2 is at 00:50:56:e0:85:18
      For host addresses ending in .1 & .2 (ie, not .128) I also see TCP SYN requests sent to them from 192.168.58.128;
      both receive [RST, ACK] TCP packets in return.

    Repeat the previous three bullets, but for the 137.22.4.0/24 network. (Note that your results will be different if
    you execute nmap while connected to the Carleton network than if you're not connected. Either choice is fine with
    me.)
      IP addresses:
        137.22.4.5
        137.22.4.17
        137.22.4.131
      What they represent:
        137.22.4.5 = elegit.mathcs.carleton.edu
        137.22.4.17 = Nmap scan report for perlman.mathcs.carleton.edu
        137.22.4.131 = maize.mathcs.carleton.edu
      What steps did nmap take?
        For each active host, two TCP handshakes were conducted between the active host and our kali machine (between
        two pairs of ports)
        Then, two [RST, SYN] request were sent (one for each TCP connection); the connections were shut down.

3. Port scanning
    Which ports does Metasploitable have open, and what services do they correspond to (e.g. port 22 / SSH or port 80 /
    HTTP)?
      21/tcp   open  ftp
      22/tcp   open  ssh
      23/tcp   open  telnet
      25/tcp   open  smtp
      53/tcp   open  domain
      80/tcp   open  http
      111/tcp  open  rpcbind
      139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
      445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
      512/tcp  open  exec
      513/tcp  open  login
      514/tcp  open  shell
      1099/tcp open  rmiregistry
      1524/tcp open  ingreslock
      2049/tcp open  nfs
      2121/tcp open  ccproxy-ftp
      3306/tcp open  mysql
      5432/tcp open  postgresql
      5900/tcp open  vnc
      6000/tcp open  X11
      6667/tcp open  irc
      8009/tcp open  ajp13
      8180/tcp open  unknown

    What database server(s) is/are available on Metasploitable?
      postgresql (5432), mysql (3306)

    What is the value of the RSA SSH host key? What is the host key for?
      56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3
      Used to (try to) prove that the accessing machines are who they say they are.

    Pick one of the open ports that has a service you have never heard of, and explain what the service does.
      1099 - rmiregistry
      It seems to bind remote object to a locally-store pseudonym, so that it can be referred to with the new name in
      the future.
